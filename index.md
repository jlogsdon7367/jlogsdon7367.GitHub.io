## Intesting Data Set: Data Cite
[DataCite](https://datacite.org/) is a very helpful organization and data set that allows researchers to assign unique identifiers to their published research. The organization keeps track of research with digital object identifiers (DOIs) that remain persistent and searchable within their database. The DOIs retain metadata with author and attribution data. This is incredibly helpful tool to look up and cite research published by the scientific community with standards that all participants can abide by.
