## Intesting Data Set: Data Cite
[DataCite](https://datacite.org/) is a very helpful organization and data set that allows researchers to assign unique identifiers to their published research. The organization keeps track of research with digital object identifiers (DOIs) that remain persistent and searchable within their database. The DOIs retain metadata with author and attribution data. This is incredibly helpful tool to look up and cite research published by the scientific community with standards that all participants can abide by.

## Interesting Book: R for Data Science
[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham is an introductory text on how to use the programming language R to model and manipulate your data. This book is very helpful for students like myself who plan to utilize programming software to visualize geographic data.
